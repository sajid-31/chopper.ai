## 🤔 Why use Chopper AI?

_"Why bother with Chopper AI when you could just type `man` or `--help` like a true Linux guru?"_  
Well... because **Chopper AI** is like having a supercharged, AI-powered buddy right inside your terminal — minus the smug attitude. 😎

### Here's why you should give it a shot:

- 🐧 **Tailored for Linux** — Designed specifically for the Linux terminal (or WSL), it understands your environment natively.
- 💻 **Terminal Command Assistance** — Whether it's obscure commands, tricky flags, or complex bash one-liners, Chopper AI can help you craft or understand them.
- ⚡ **Code Auto-Execution** — Not just suggestions, Chopper AI can directly execute commands for you (with your consent, of course).
- 🔄 **Customizable** — Easily adaptable to your favorite models, prompts, and workflows.
- 🔐 **Secure** — Your API keys are encrypted using Fernet and stored safely on your machine.
- 🧩 **Extensible** — Modular design makes it easy to extend and add new features.

In short:  
It's like `man`, `--help`, and StackOverflow had a terminal-native AI baby... and it listens to you.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Chopper AI, ensure that you have the following dependencies set up:

- **Linux OS or WSL**
- **Python 3.7+**  
  Chopper AI requires Python 3.7 or later. You can check your version using:  
  ```sh
  python3 --version
  ```
- **Pipx**
  ```sh
  pip install --user pipx
  pipx ensure path
  ```
  Restart your linux terminal after you install pipx for the first time

```
 - Chopper.ai will ask for an API KEY
 - Create a free API KEY at [https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) and paste it in the terminal
 - Chopper.ai uses [Fernet Module](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/src/cryptography/fernet.py) to encrypt and decrypt your API Keys and saves it locally.

- Installs Chopper AI globally using pipx.
- Runs the initial configuration (config.py) to set up API keys.
- Provides a quick overview of Chopper AI's features.
